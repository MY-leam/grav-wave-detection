## Background Information

Gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime, generated by accelerated masses, that propagate as waves outward from their source at the speed of light. Gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation, a form of radiant energy similar to electromagnetic radiation. They allow the observation of the merger of black holes and possibly other exotic objects in the distant Universe.

## Model Introduction

The model being utilized in this project is a 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network with GeM pooling.
